We need to have a class with several helper functions
    We should use a constructor that sets state

Helper functions
    - Empty the grid
        - empty state
    - Setting state (this is where the duplicated data would be sent)
        - set state 
    - Create 2nd graph (this is where the original data would be sent)
        - create a new graph
        -
